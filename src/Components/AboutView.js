                    I am a second-year student of Computer Science at Faculty of
                    Computer Science, Electronics and Telecommunications at AGH
                    University of Science and Technology in Krakow. Designing
                    modern web applications is my passion, but I am also open to
                    other fields of programming. I am interested in an
                    internship in the position of Frontend Developer, which
                    would let me broaden my skills and gain an essential job
                    experience. I will gladly send you your CV if you are
                    interested.
